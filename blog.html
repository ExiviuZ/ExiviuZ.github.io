                <p>Early in the morning I woke up with some pretty bad news oof... My sister's husband already had a bad day and accidentally forgot about his duty. We then took a joyride outside so I can accompany him to make him feel happy and supported. I help him through places we've been through and always been active throughout the day. Haven't gotten any practice coding this day cause it has been busy, I took a sleep after we went home and at the evening as our duty, we took off for night worship service to end this day.</p>

                <p>Woke up early because of our playful and noisy dog named 'Brown' and slept again. After waking up I ate breakfast and help my sister's husband clean up the Church to get ready for Special Event, after this tiresome hours my family came in to visit together with my 5 years old brother and we bonded during the afternoon. After they went home and I go some free time. I continued learning HTML as I usually do when I'm available to maximize my potential and this Markup Language's potential. This day I made a webpage for recipe book about my favorite dishes here in my country and I shared it to my friends for them to rate it. Like what I expected I took some criticism, praise and appreciation which is what I really wanted. I'll continue to be productive every single day and not waste my precious time to meet what I want in this life :). Onward until the end!</p>
